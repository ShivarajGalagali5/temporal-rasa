# temporal-rasa
Operational time geometry in general relativity. Temporal Rasa develops a UV/IR-complete framework for time transport, vorticity, temporal holonomy, soft charges, and curvature, with applications from local geometry reconstruction to gravitational memory. Includes full paper series (I–V), derivations, and LaTeX sources.
